:trophy: Improve The Governance UX Winner $7,500 - DemocraDot
</h3>
<br>
<i>

Participants were encouraged to build and submit projects in either of the following categories:
* Cross-chain dApps on the Moonbeam network
* Moonbeam Governance improvements 

We decided to submit a project that would try to improve the governance experience on Moonbeam.
We believe that in order to improve governance participation across any blockchain, the information flow and decision making has to move away from the desktop and onto the mobile.

Therefore for this project we decided to take the harder development route of building with a mobile only approach.

Our project showcased the ability to:

* Browse the latest proposals and referenda from a mobile device
* Vote and endorse on live referenda from a mobile device 
* Receive mobile PUSH notifications on various stages of the democratic process

Technologies used during the mobile project included:
* Metamask mobile integration for connectivity and signing vote submissions
* Subquery indexing on democracy data for displaying Propasal and Referenda information on the mobile device

## Polkadot North America Hackathon
***
<p>1137 Participants
<br>
<p>The Polkadot Hackathon Global Series North America Edition was the second in a series of global hackathons that brought the cutting edge of blockchain to the global community.

Focusing on Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama, this hackathon was open to both individuals and teams anywhere in the world. As well as blockchain building, participants took advantage of mentoring hours and networking opportunities that were invaluable when starting new projects or building teams.

:trophy: Overall Grand Prize Winner $30,000 - XCM DOT AUTOSTAKE
<br>
:trophy: Build An XCM Related Tool For Moonbeam $5000 - XCM DOT AUTOSTAKE
</h3>
<br>
<i>
We built this project to solve the current problem of a user having to manually manage their DOT asset holdings on multiple parachains if they wish to stake DOT for Liquid DOT in the Acala Ecosystem. The project achieves the following:<br>

* A simple UI walks the user through the process of autostaking DOT from any parachain onto Acala for LDOT.
* Unstaking LDOT Back to DOT is also facilitated.
* The UI also provides the user with the ability to transfer a wide selection of assets between Parachains and Relay Chains on the Polkadot Ecosystem. 
* The project makes extensive use of the Cross Consensus Messaging Format (XCM).

To showcase the project, the following assets and chains were included in the project:

<h3 align="center">
:trophy: Acala EVM+ DApp For aUSD Yield - $5,000 - ACALA LDOT YIELD MANAGER
</h3>
<br>
<i>
We built this project to allow the user to stake DOT for LDOT and then periodically take the accumulated LDOT yield and automatically swap it for other assets on the Acala platform, such as aUSD and/or ACA.<br>
This allows the user to create a regular Dollar Cost Average (DCA) investment strategy using the passive income from their staked LDOT.<br>
The project made extensive use of the following to allow the user to choose the desired reinvestment strategy for their LDOT yield:<br>

* Acala Scheduler
* Acala DEX
* Acala EVM 

We created a smart contract strategy that automates the monitoring and collecting of LDOT yield on a regular basis.<br>
Whilst the amount of Staked LDOT from the user remains the same at all times, the value of that LDOT (in DOT) slowly appreciates over time. By using the Acala Scheduler to run regular sweeps of the excess yield that has accumulated, we then swapped this excess DOT for another asset of the users choice using the Acala DEX before transferring it back to the user.<br>

## Amsterdot Hackathon
***
<p>351 Participants 
<br>
<p>The AmsterDOT Hackathon was an 8-week long online event which kicked off on 20th April 2022 - the beginning of the AmsterDOT Conference, and lasted until 20th June 2022. 

The aim of the hackathon was to create a team-overarching effort which incentivizes contributions to the Polkadot ecosystem. For this purpose, 20 bounties were submitted by 8 ecosystem teams: HydraDX, Basilisk, Acala, Astar, Interlay, Phala, Subsquid and Moonbeam. 

The results of the voting for the prize pool were presented live at Polkadot Decoded in Berlin, and were furthermore published on the amsterDOT website.

:trophy: Acala Cross Chain DApp Bounty Winner $5,000 - MORPH FOR ACALA
<br>
:trophy: Cross Chain Transfer SDK $10k BSX + $10k HDX - MORPH FOR BASILISK
</h3>
<br>
<i>
We built the MORPH project to showcase how it is possible to transfer a wide selection of assets between Parachains and Relay Chains via the Cross Consensus Messaging Format (XCM).

In addition to XCM transfers the project also included the ability to:
* Autostake KSM onto Karura FROM ANY PARACHAIN with a few simple clicks.
* Unstake LKSM directly from within the DApp.

<br>
Further Information<br>
Two kinds of vertical message-passing transport protocols have been used in the project:

* Upward Message Passing (UMP): This allows parachains to send messages to their relay chain.

* Downward Message Passing (DMP): This allows the relay chain to pass messages down to one of its parachains.

In addition, the project used Horizontal Relay-routed Message Passing (HMRP): This allows the parachains to parachain messaging on the same relay chain.

To showcase the project, the following assets and chains were included in the project:

:trophy: Overall Prize Winner $9,000 - ACALA LDOT YIELD MANAGER
<br>
:trophy: Acala EVM+ DApp For aUSD Yield - $5,000 - ACALA LDOT YIELD MANAGER
</h3>
<br>
<i>
We built the Yield Manager makes it easy to:

* Manage any AUSD staking yield automatically at pre-determined times.
* Autoswap AUSD yield for other assets, such as DOT and/or ACA.

This project makes extensive use of the Acala Scheduler to allow the user to choose the desired reinvestment strategy for their AUSD yield from existing liquidity pools.

We created multiple smart contracts for this project.

Firstly we needed to create a form of staking income so the user could stake their asset, for example DOT, and receive aUSD. They could then either keep the aUSD as income or they could swap the aUSD for ACA or another asset e.g. DOT or LDOT to establish an ongoing dollar cost average (DCA) strategy.

We created a staking smart contract whereby the staked DOT is paid a yield in aUSD.

In addition we created a smart contract strategy to automate the yield collection of aUSD on a regular basis using the Acala Scheduler and then swap it for ACA before transferring it back to the user.<br>

## The Encode Polkadot Accelerator Program
***
<p>December 2021 - February 2022
<br>
<p>The Polkadot Accelerator Program was a 10-week, online accelerator taking the best hackathon and early-stage projects worldwide and helping them take the leap to become fully-fledged startups.
<br><br>

The structure of the Accelerator included the following:

* Weekly workshops to discuss project building
* Dedicated 1-1 mentorship meetings
* $4k Stipend per team
* The program ended with a pitch day for follow on funding and grants

Workshop Topics Included:

* Rapid Prototyping
* Lean Startup Methods
* Product Market Fit
* Marketing
* Meetings With Investors / Entrepreneurs
<br>

<i>
During the Accelerator Program we built a project called Calibrate.<br>
This was a DEFI DApp that offered a simple way for new users to invest in a basket of cryptocurrencies.

The DApp made it simple for a user to just deposit only stable assets and choose an area of Crypto that they were interested in from a range of groups we had setup using smart contracts.

We would then automatically batch swap the stable assets into the correct weightings for the group (vault) they had chosen via the Acala DEX.

Periodically the vaults would rebalance to make sure that the weighting of the holdings were at the correct values according to either market cap or volatility.
Highlights included:

* Individual smart contract vaults for DEFI, Gaming, Layer 1s, Oracles, Top 20 assets, Ecosystems etc
* Automatic rebalancing of vaults according to market market cap or volatility
