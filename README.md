## Polkadot North America Hackathon
***
<p>Entries: 1137
<br>
<p>The Polkadot Hackathon Global Series North America Edition was the second in a series of global hackathons that brought the cutting edge of blockchain to the global community.

Focusing on Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama, this hackathon was open to both individuals and teams anywhere in the world. As well as blockchain building, participants took advantage of mentoring hours and networking opportunities that were invaluable when starting new projects or building teams.

Grand Prize Winner $30,000 - XCM DOT AUTOSTAKE
</h3>
<i>
We built this project to solve the current problem of a user having to manually manage their DOT asset holdings on multiple parachains if they wish to stake DOT for Liquid DOT in the Acala Ecosystem. The project achieves the following:<br>

* A simple UI walks the user through the process of autostaking DOT from any parachain onto Acala for LDOT.
* Unstaking LDOT Back to DOT is also facilitated.
* The UI also provides the user with the ability to transfer a wide selection of assets between Parachains and Relay Chains on the Polkadot Ecosystem. 
* The project makes extensive use of the Cross Consensus Messaging Format (XCM).

Acala EVM+ DApp For aUSD Yield - $5,000 - ACALA LDOT YIELD MANAGER
</h3>

<i>
We built this project to allow the user to stake DOT for LDOT and then periodically take the accumulated LDOT yield and automatically swap it for other assets on the Acala platform, such as aUSD and/or ACA.<br>
This allows the user to create a regular Dollar Cost Average (DCA) investment strategy using the passive income from their staked LDOT.<br>
The project made extensive use of the following to allow the user to choose the desired reinvestment strategy for their LDOT yield:<br>

* Acala Scheduler
* Acala DEX
* Acala EVM 

We created a smart contract strategy that automates the monitoring and collecting of LDOT yield on a regular basis.<br>
Whilst the amount of Staked LDOT from the user remains the same at all times, the value of that LDOT (in DOT) slowly appreciates over time. By using the Acala Scheduler to run regular sweeps of the excess yield that has accumulated, we then swapped this excess DOT for another asset of the users choice using the Acala DEX before transferring it back to the user.<br>
